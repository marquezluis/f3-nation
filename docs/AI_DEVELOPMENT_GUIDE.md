## How AI tools load this guidance

Different developers use different assistants. To keep one source of truth, this
repo uses the **`AGENTS.md` standard** as canonical and adds thin pointer files
so each tool resolves to the same content:

| Tool                     | Entry point it reads                         | What it contains                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **All / standard**       | [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) (root + per-app) | Canonical conventions              |
| **Claude** (Claude Code) | `CLAUDE.md`                                  | Pointer → `AGENTS.md` + this guide |
| **GitHub Copilot**       | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`            | Pointer → `AGENTS.md` + this guide |
| **Cursor**               | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`                        | Pointer → `AGENTS.md` + this guide |

**Rule of thumb:** put durable guidance in `AGENTS.md` (or, for deep topics, in
`docs/` and link it). Keep the tool-specific pointer files thin so they never
drift. Per-app specifics live in that app's `AGENTS.md`
(e.g. [`apps/me/AGENTS.md`](../apps/me/AGENTS.md),
[`apps/auth/AGENTS.md`](../apps/auth/AGENTS.md)).

## Golden rules

1. **Authorize every endpoint, not just authenticate it.** "Is a user logged in"
   is not authorization. See [API authorization](#api-authorization).
2. **Never trust an ID from the request body.** Scope to the session subject or
   verify a role on the target resource.
3. **Credentials come from a CSPRNG, never `Math.random()`.**
4. **Never log or bake in secrets or PII.** Not to stdout, not into Docker
   layers, not into the repo.
5. **Assume multi-instance.** No in-memory rate limiters/locks/caches as the
   source of truth in production.
6. **Anything `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is public.** It ships in the browser bundle.
7. **Validate at the boundary, then trust internally.** Zod-validate all
   external input; don't add defensive checks for impossible internal states.
8. **Make the smallest correct change.** Match existing patterns; don't refactor
   or add abstractions beyond what the task needs.

## API authorization

The API (`packages/api`, served via oRPC) defines procedure tiers in
[`packages/api/src/shared.ts`](../packages/api/src/shared.ts). Choose the
**most restrictive** tier that fits, and remember what each one actually
guarantees:

| Procedure                 | Guarantee                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `publicProcedure`         | No auth. Rate-limited only. Safe for truly public, read-only data.                                                                   |
| `protectedProcedure`      | A valid session/credential exists. **Does _not_ check what that user may touch.**                                                    |
| `editorProcedure`         | Caller has editor or admin role on **any** org. Resource-scoped auth (`checkHasRoleOnOrg`) is still required for specific resources. |
| `adminProcedure`          | Caller has admin role on **any** org. Resource-scoped auth still required.                                                           |
| `nationAdminProcedure`    | Caller has the nation-level admin role specifically.                                                                                 |
| `revalidateAuthProcedure` | Accepts either a valid `SUPER_ADMIN_API_KEY` header or a nation admin session. Used for cache revalidation.                          |
| `apiKeyProcedure`         | Accepts a valid API key (`x-api-key` header), either the super-admin key or a DB-registered key.                                     |

### The critical pitfall: `protectedProcedure` ≠ authorized

`protectedProcedure` only proves _someone_ is authenticated. It does **not**
prove the caller may act on the resource named in the input. If a handler takes a
`userId`, `orgId`, `eventId`, etc. from the input and acts on it without an
ownership or role check, **any** authenticated caller can act on **anyone's**
data (IDOR, CWE-639; PII exposure, CWE-200).

```ts
// ❌ WRONG — authenticated but not authorized.
// Any logged-in caller can write attendance for an arbitrary user.
createActual: protectedProcedure
  .input(z.object({ eventInstanceId: z.number(), userId: z.number() }))
  .handler(async ({ context: ctx, input }) => {
    await ctx.db.insert(schema.attendance).values({
      eventInstanceId: input.eventInstanceId,
      userId: input.userId, // <-- caller-supplied target, never verified
    });
  });
```

Fix with one of these, depending on intent:

```ts
// ✅ Self-only: ignore body userId, use the session subject.
const userId = ctx.session!.id;

// ✅ Or require a role on the target resource (resolve the org first).
const { success } = await checkHasRoleOnOrg({
  session: ctx.session,
  orgId: targetOrgId,
  roleName: "editor",
  db: ctx.db,
});
if (!success) throw new ORPCError("UNAUTHORIZED");
```

Use [`checkHasRoleOnOrg`](../packages/api/src/check-has-role-on-org.ts) — it
walks the org hierarchy (AO → region → … → nation) so a region admin is
authorized for its AOs. When you call it in a loop over many orgs, batch where
possible to avoid N+1 queries.

### Reads expose PII too

A `protectedProcedure` that returns `users.email`, `f3Name`, or other personal
data must scope to the session subject or a role on the org — otherwise any
authenticated caller can enumerate everyone's data. Treat read authorization with
the same rigor as writes.

### Public data without a browser credential

If a surface is genuinely public (e.g. the map), prefer making the specific read
endpoints `publicProcedure` over shipping an API key to the browser. A
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` API key is extractable from the bundle and, because an API-key
session passes every `protectedProcedure`, it grants far more than the public
surface intends. Scope public access at the endpoint, not via a shared public
credential.

---

## Authentication & tokens

- **CSPRNG only** for OTPs, verification tokens, session tokens, nonces, API
  keys: `crypto.randomInt`, `crypto.randomBytes`, `crypto.getRandomValues`.
  Never `Math.random()`.
- **Verify JWTs, don't just decode them.** Validate signature with the
  algorithm allow-list (`RS256`), `issuer`, and `audience`/`client_id` against
  the JWKS. Decoding the payload (e.g. `parseAccessTokenPayload`) is for reading
  claims _after_ verification — never as the trust boundary. Avoid designs where
  a single middleware is the _only_ verifier for many handlers; if you rely on
  that, make the coupling explicit and tested.
- **OAuth/OIDC:** enforce PKCE and reject `plain`; validate `state`/`nonce`;
  allow-list redirect URIs (no open redirect); rate-limit `revoke`/`userinfo`.
- **Refresh-token rotation:** if the server single-uses (delete-on-use) refresh
  tokens, the client must **not** refresh concurrently per-request, or
  simultaneous requests at expiry will race, redeem the same token, and force
  logouts. Either give rotation a short grace window with chain-linking on the
  server, or single-flight the refresh on the client. See
  [`apps/auth/AGENTS.md`](../apps/auth/AGENTS.md) and the `me`/`admin` middleware.
- **MFA / email codes in local dev** are captured by Mailpit / Ethereal — see
  [`docs/QA_LOCAL_AUTH.md`](QA_LOCAL_AUTH.md). Don't disable verification to make
  flows pass; drive them properly.

---

## Secrets & sensitive data

- **Never log** tokens, passwords, OTPs, full `Authorization` headers, raw OAuth
  account objects, or PII. On Cloud Run, stdout goes to Cloud Logging (CWE-532).
  Avoid hardcoded `LOG = true` debug flags; gate verbose logging behind an env
  var and keep credentials out of it entirely.
- **Never bake secrets into Docker images.** Don't `COPY` a populated `.env` into
  the runner stage and don't `echo` token values during the build. Use build
  secrets / runtime injection (GCP Secret Manager surfaced via Cloud Run env vars, not baked layers).
- **No real PII in the repo** — seed scripts, fixtures, and tests use synthetic
  data (e.g. `dev-admin@f3local.dev`), never real members' emails. The repo is
  public.
- **Env access:** read configuration through the validated env schema
  (`@acme/env`), not raw `process.env`, so missing/invalid config fails fast.
  Store secrets in per-directory `.env` files; never commit them.

---

## Web / HTTP security

- **Set security headers** in each app's `next.config.*` (or middleware): CSP,
  HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`,
  `Permissions-Policy`, and framing controls. Use `X-Frame-Options: DENY` /
  `frame-ancestors 'none'` for auth/admin surfaces; the map is intentionally
  embeddable and needs a `frame-ancestors` **allow-list**, not a blanket deny.
  Disable `poweredByHeader`.
- **Sanitize untrusted HTML.** `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` must run through
  DOMPurify; escape all user input interpolated into email templates.
- **File uploads:** authenticate the endpoint, enforce a size cap (don't
  `await file.arrayBuffer()` on unbounded input), derive Content-Type/extension
  from a server-side allow-list (not attacker-controlled `file.type`), and encode
  object paths to prevent overwrite/traversal. The admin upload path is the
  reference implementation.

---

## Data layer

- **Connection pooling for Cloud Run.** The shared client lives in
  [`packages/db/src/utils/functions.ts`](../packages/db/src/utils/functions.ts).
  Configure bounded `max`, plus `connect_timeout` and `idle_timeout`, sized so
  `instances × max` stays under the Postgres/PgBouncer ceiling. Match the driver
  to the pooler: with **PgBouncer transaction pooling**, set `prepare: false`
  (prepared statements break in that mode). Make SSL behavior explicit and
  environment-aware.
- **Migrations** (Drizzle, `packages/db`): generate and commit migrations; keep
  the journal consistent; run migrations as a **deploy step**, not during
  `docker build`. Use `pnpm db:pull` / `db:push` and `reset-test-db` per
  [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
- **Indexes & N+1:** add indexes for hot lookups and join foreign keys
  (especially role/permission tables). Avoid per-row queries inside `for await`
  loops — batch them.
- **Raw SQL** must be parameterized (Drizzle `sql` tagged templates bind
  params); never string-concatenate user input.

---

## Reliability in a multi-instance world

- Cloud Run autoscales. Anything kept in process memory — rate limiters, caches,
  locks, counters — is **per-instance**. For correctness across instances use a
  shared store (Redis/Upstash) or a DB-backed mechanism. In-memory is acceptable
  only as a best-effort optimization, and must be documented as such.
- Add timeouts to outbound calls; make webhook/handlers idempotent; paginate or
  bound any "return all" query.

## Pre-flight checklist for AI-generated changes

Before proposing a diff, confirm:

- [ ] New/!changed endpoints use the correct procedure tier and **authorize the
      specific resource** (no trusting body IDs).
- [ ] No `Math.random()` for anything credential-like.
- [ ] No secrets/PII added to logs, images, fixtures, or the repo.
- [ ] No `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value grants server privileges.
- [ ] External input is Zod-validated; raw SQL is parameterized.
- [ ] No new in-memory-only state assumed to be global in production.
- [ ] Untrusted HTML sanitized; uploads bounded and typed server-side.
- [ ] Matches existing patterns; smallest reasonable change; no unrequested
      refactors, comments, or abstractions.
- [ ] `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and relevant tests pass; commit message has
      a valid scope.
